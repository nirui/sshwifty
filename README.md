on your computer or server to provide SSH and Telnet access interface for any
compatible (standard) web browser.

## Install

### Binary

Compiled binaries can be found at the [release] section of the page.

Please be advised that those binaries are generated by an automatic proccess,
the author of this project will NOT verify that they work. You will have to try it at your own
risk.

[release]: https://github.com/nirui/sshwifty/releases

### Docker Image

If [Docker] is installed on your machine, you may use our prebuilt Docker Image
by executing following command:

```
$ docker run --detach \
  --restart always \
  --publish 8182:8182 \
  --name sshwifty \
  niruix/sshwifty:latest
```

When TLS is desired and you don't want to setup Docker Volumes, you can use
`SSHWIFTY_DOCKER_TLSCERT` and `SSHWIFTY_DOCKER_TLSCERTKEY` environment variables
to import credential files to the container and automatically apply them:

```
$ openssl req \
  -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout domain.key -x509 -days 90 -out domain.crt
$ docker run --detach \
  --restart always \
  --publish 8182:8182 \
  --env SSHWIFTY_DOCKER_TLSCERT="$(cat domain.crt)" \
  --env SSHWIFTY_DOCKER_TLSCERTKEY="$(cat domain.key)" \
  --name sshwifty \
  niruix/sshwifty:latest
```

The `domain.crt` and `domain.key` must be a valid TLS certificate and key file
located on the same machine which the `docker run` command will be executed
upon.

### Compile from source code (Recommanded if you're a developer)

The following tools are required in order to build the software from source code:

- `git` to download the source code
- `node` and `npm` to build front-end application
- `go` to build back-end application

To start the build process, execute:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nirui/sshwifty
$ cd sshwifty
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

When done, you can found the newly generated `sshwifty` binary inside the current
working directory.

Notice: `Dockerfile` contains the entire build procedure of this software.
Please refer to it when you encounter any compile/build related issue.

### Deploy on the cloud

To deploy this project onto the cloud, Google App Engine or Heroku for example,
you need to first download the source code, then generate it locally before
deploying it.

`npm run generate` command will generate all static files and automatically
call `go generate ./...` to bind those static files directly into program source
code. And you need those generated source code to get the software to function.

Trying to deploy ungenerated code directly to cloud will lead to failure, as
required source code is missing.

Also keep in mind, if the cloud deployment process is `git` based, you may have
to modify `.gitignore` file in order to allow all required files to be uploaded.

## Configure

Sshwifty can be configured through either file or environment variables. By
default, the configuration loader will try to load file from default paths
first, when failed, environment variables will be used.

You can also specify your own configuration file by setting up `SSHWIFTY_CONFIG`
environment variable before start the software. For example:

```
$ SSHWIFTY_CONFIG=./sshwifty.conf.json ./sshwifty
```

This way, Sshwifty will try to load the configuration from file
`./sshwifty.conf.json`, and never reach for other environment variables.

### Configuration file

Here is all the options of a configuration file:

```
{
  // HTTP Host. Keep it empty to accept request from all hosts, otherwise, only
  // specified host is allowed to access
  "HostName": "localhost",

  // Web interface access password. Set to empty to allow public access to the
  // web interface (By pass the Authenticate page)
  "SharedKey": "WEB_ACCESS_PASSWORD",

  // Remote dial timeout. This limits how long of time the backend can spend
  // to connect to a remote host. The max timeout will be determined by
  // server configuration (ReadTimeout).
  // (In Seconds)

  // Socks5 proxy. When set, Sshwifty backend will try to connect remote through
  // the given proxy

}
```

`sshwifty.conf.example.json` is an example of a valid configuration file.

### Environment variables

Valid environment variables are:

```
SSHWIFTY_HOSTNAME
SSHWIFTY_SHAREDKEY
SSHWIFTY_DIALTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_SOCKS5
SSHWIFTY_SOCKS5_USER
SSHWIFTY_SOCKS5_PASSWORD
SSHWIFTY_LISTENPORT
SSHWIFTY_INITIALTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_READTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_WRITETIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_HEARTBEATTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_READDELAY
SSHWIFTY_WRITEELAY
SSHWIFTY_LISTENINTERFACE
SSHWIFTY_TLSCERTIFICATEFILE
SSHWIFTY_TLSCERTIFICATEKEYFILE
SSHWIFTY_PRESETS
SSHWIFTY_ONLYALLOWPRESETREMOTES
```

The options they represent correspond to their counterparts in the
configuration file.

Notice: When you're using environment variables to configure Sshwifty, only one
Sshwifty HTTP server is then allowed. There is no way to setup mulitple servers
under this method of configuration. If you need to serve on multiple ports, use
the configuration file instead.

Be aware: An invalid value inside following environment variables will cause
the value to be sliently reset to default during configuration parsing phase
without warning:

```
SSHWIFTY_DIALTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_INITIALTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_READTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_WRITETIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_HEARTBEATTIMEOUT
SSHWIFTY_READDELAY
SSHWIFTY_WRITEELAY
```

## FAQ

### Why the software says "The time difference is beyond operational limit"?

This usually happens when the clock on the client and/or the server is unsynced
beyond tolerance.

Please make sure the clock time on both the client and the server are correct by
resync them with a NTP server, and then reload the page. The problem should be
gone afterwards.

### Why I got error "TypeError: Cannot read property 'importKey' of undefined"

It's usually because your web browser does not support WebCrypt API (such as
`window.crypto.subtle` or anything under `window.crypto`), or the support has
been disabled.

If you're using Google Chrome, please connect Sshwifty with HTTPS. Chrome will
disable WebCrypt and many other APIs when the connection is not safe.

### Can I serve Sshwifty under a subpath such as `https://my.domain/ssh`?

The short story is NO. Sshwifty was designed based on an assumption that it will
run as the only service under a given hostname, allowing web browsers to better
enforce their data isolation rules. This is very important because Sshwifty
saves user data locally.

However, if you really want to put Sshwifty into a subpath, you can do so by
taking advantage of the fact that Sshwifty backend interface and assets are
always located under an URL prefix `/sshwifty`. You can thus redirect or proxy
those requests to their new location.

Keep in mind, doing so is really hacky, and it's not recommended by the author
thus no support will be provided if you decide to go with that.

### Why I can't add my own key combinations to the Console tool bar?

The pre-defined key combinations are there mainly to make mobile operation
possible as well as to resolve some hotkey conflicts. However, if efficiency is
your first goal, please consider to use a software/on screen keyboard which is
specially designed for terminal.

And if that's not enough, connect a physical keyboard through Bluetooth or OTA
could be a better alternative. This way you can type as if you're using a
computer console.
